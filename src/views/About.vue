        Write an application with Vue.js & Vuetify with which you can explore
        beers from the Punk API. You should be able to search and filter the
        beers. https://punkapi.com/
      </p>
      <p>
        Your application has to be as vuetiful as it can be! ;) It does not have
        to be production-ready code, we would like to see, how beautiful and
        usable things you can create in a short time period.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please do it even if you are more interested in the backend position,
        since eventually, everyone will be a full-stack dev at our company.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please deploy the application to a Github page and paste the url here.
        (You have 3 days to accomplish this quest.)
